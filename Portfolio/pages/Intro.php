        <p> <span style="margin-left: 30px;">Hello!!</span> I'm Omar Mayassi, an undergraduate at the Lebanese 
            American University majoring in Computer Science. In the past few months, I've gained a liking towards
            the world of cybersecurity. The whole operation and its evolution was quite fascinating for me, and I felt
            like a it was all revolving around the game of cat and mouse. Such constant challenges is what attracted 
            me to this field. Other than that, I'm just a normal guy who enjoys hanging out with friends, and watching 
            fast cars go vroom, especially the F1 series. Take a tour round my website and hope you enjoy!!
